A minor enhancement release which adds tables with sparklines, and
persistent sessions.

* [on Github](https://github.com/urbanairship/tessera/releases/tag/v0.8.2)
* [on Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tessera/0.8.2)

## Dashboard Enhancements

### Sparktables

Not actually a new dashboard item, the Summation Table gets
several new options that expand its utility greatly - the ability
to choose which columns are visible, and an optional sparkline
column.

Summation Tables can now also set a title.

## Bug Fixes

* Sessions are now persistent, so preferences will survive a browser restart.
