UPDATE: Release 0.8.1 of Tessera is now available. Release 0.8.0 had a
minor dependency problem. Fixing it is the only change in 0.8.1.

## Dashboard Enhancements

### Table Legends

The placeholder `table` legend type is a placeholder no
more. Selecting `table` as the legend type for any chart will render a
summation table as the legend.

### More Interactivity

The interactive renderer now has additional interactive features. For
line and area charts with legends, mousing over the legend will now
highlight the corresponding series on the chart, as will mousing over
the series itself.

For the stacked area chart type, there are also new actions to
dynamically switch the stack mode to `none`, `stack`, `stream`, or
`percent` mode.

### Logarithmic Y-Axis

The Y-axis of time series charts can now be set to a logarithmic
scale.

### Chart Resizing

The flot resize plugin, `jquery.flot.resize.js` is now included, so
dynamic charts will automatically redraw if the browser window is
resized, or when resizing cells while editing.

### Embedding

There's a new UI endpoint which renders dashboards with none of the
navigation UI chrome (not even the dashboard title) - it's intended
for embedding small dashboards in other sites via the use of iframes.

The new endpoint is `/dashboards/<id>/<slug>/embed`. I.e. just take an
existing dashboard URL and add `/embed` to the end of it. It accepts
all the same query parameters as the regular endpoint, so it can be
used with templatized dashboards, you can specify the time range, or
the color theme, etc...

## API Enhancements

### CORS

The API now supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing, which enables the
Tessera API to be called from other browser-based tooling, opening up
integration possibilities.


## Bug Fixes

* Auto-refresh now reloads static PNG images
* Legends are now rendered consistently between both renderers, which
  makes the graph sizes consistent between flot and graphite.
