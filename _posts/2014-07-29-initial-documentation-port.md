The initial set of
[documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/)
has been ported over from just being raw Markdown files in the github
repo to being proper pages on Tessera' Github Pages website.

We'll start fleshing them out more fully now that there's a proper
host for them, starting with expanding on the the
[templating documentation](https://github.com/tessera-metrics/tessera/issues/252).

Go check out the new [documentation section]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/).
