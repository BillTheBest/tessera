After 465 days since release 0.8.2, release 0.9 of Tessera is ready!
This release fixes all the outstanding bug issues that have been
filed, and adds some minor enhancements as well. After this release
I'll be starting on some more major refactoring work to support some
of the major features that have been sitting idle for years.

* [on Github](https://github.com/urbanairship/tessera/releases/tag/v0.9.2)
* [on Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tessera/0.9.2)

## Dashboard Enhancements

### Singlegraph Grids

Singlegraph grids are a new dashboard item that, oddly enough, renders
the data as a grid of singlegraphs, one per data series.

## Other New Features

* Added a graphite importer to the Import page, to import from a
  Graphite dashboard URL
* Added ways to quickly view the query associated with a dashboard
  item. There's a "View Query" menu item in the action menu, and the
  query text is displayed in the "Isolate" transform.
* Python 3 compatibility. There may be some issues with migrating
  browser sessions if you switch from Python 2 to Python 3. Deleting
  the cookie for your tessera server should fix them.

### Bug Fixes and Other Enhancements

* Added confirmation before navigating away with unsaved changes.
* Fixed a major DOM leak
* Fixed an occasional spurious alert dialog
* Fixed occasional clipping of tooltips
* Fixed singlegraph rendering issues
* Fixed renaming of queries
* Fixed a bug in data range selection
* Added validation to the import page, to avoid attempting to import invalid dashboards
* HTTP requests to Graphite won't break caching
